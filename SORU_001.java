White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing)
is a method of software testing that tests internal structures or workings of an application,
as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system,
as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases.
